# Fake-News-Detection-By-Naive_Bayes
###### Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.
### A simple program build on Pythonn 3.x inside Jupyter Notebook
I have used Naive-Bayes-Classifer inside which GaussianNB Classifier, You can use MultinomialNB also by just replacing GaussianNB written in the code.

To run:
Simply download the project and run the file 
## fake_news.ipynb 
inside Jupyter Notebook(Assuming you have pandas library installed)
